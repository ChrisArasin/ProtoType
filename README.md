# ProtoType
A small css framework for type-focused layouts.

# Getting Started
In the /sass/ folder, duplicate main.scss or one of the sample theme files. Then, in the Gruntfile, update the themeName variable to the name of your new root scss file. Run grunt watch and have fun designing editorial layouts in the browser.
